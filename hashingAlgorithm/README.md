#### Requirements of a good Hashing algorithm
    - Reasonably fast
    - should not have collisions
    - it should not be possible to use the hash to get the original input (one way hashing)
    - should be deterministic
    - any change in the input, however small, should result in a completely different hash output

#### Hashing Algorithms
    - MD5, Message Digest Algorithm
    - SHA, Secure Hashing Algorithm
        - SHA1
        - SHA2
        - SHA3
